sigVars, bkdVars, sigWts, bkdWts are lists of variable values <br/>

varNames is a list of names for the variables <br/>

</li>
<li>
<p>Create a run and pass it a dataset: myRun = run(myDataset).
A run holds all information about all nodes and all playouts for all playouts that you have run on it (see below). <br/>
myDataset is the dataset to use for the run. Additional arguments define how the path will be optimized (see below)<br/></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Execute one or more playouts for your run: playouts(myRun,100,[-2],50)<br/>
myRun: is the run to execute playouts on<br/>
100: is the number of events to use per playout<br/>
[-2]: describes the type of playouts to execute (see below)<br/>
50: is the number of playouts to execute<br/></p>
<p>playout types:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>[-1] is compressed tree.
I.e. nodes are included/excluded
based on their performance independent of what other
variables were inc/exc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[-2] is full tree, but see parameter settings for details on this.</p>
</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Execute more playouts on the run as needed.
Once a run object is created and playouts have been run (steps above), you can continue to run playouts on it,
and it will continue to accrue statistics from these playouts and add the results to the run's stored information.

you want to continue with more playouts starting from the current state of the run.</p>

<li>
<p>getEvalParm: Both sides of a node must be visited this many times before either gate can be closed.
This is a
subtle and important parameter for full-tree mode.
In full-tree mode, closing a gate on one of the variables means
that if any node anywhere in the tree has gateEvalParm visits to both its include and exclude sides,
then the variable will be evaluated for possible closing one of the gates.
However, when that gate is closed,
that variable is now always included or excluded no matter where it appears in the tree in future path searches. The
nice feature of this approach is that initially, only variables near the top of the tree
(i.e., small var numbers),
which receive more visits can be shut off, since they are the nodes that will reach this threshold first.
However,
as low-numbered variables have one of their gates closed, gates further down the tree will get more visits.
So the
gate actions will propagate down the tree as playouts increase.
If one wants a proper full-tree mode with no gates
ever being closed, just set this parameter to be very large. There is currently no way to turn off gates in
individual nodes in a full tree.</p>

can be implemented to choose a side. Below this value, we flip a coin to choose a side.</p>

Usage:

Code written by Jesse Ernst and Nick Carrara
Based on https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.09449 by Nick Carrara and Jesse Ernst and
on a modified Monte Carlo Tree Search method by Jesse Ernst and Nick Carrara.

1. Create a dataset myDataset = dataset(setName, sigVars, bkdVars, sigWts, bkdWts, varNums, varNames)
sigVars, bkdVars, sigWts, bkdWts are lists of variable values &lt;br/&gt;
varNums is just a list of integers for the variables &lt;br/&gt;
varNames is a list of names for the variables &lt;br/&gt;
Optional arguments allow for specifying some variables as discrete and also for normalizing inputs &lt;br/&gt;

2. Create a run and pass it a dataset: myRun = run(myDataset).
A run holds all information about all nodes and all playouts for all playouts that you have run on it (see below). &lt;br/&gt;
myDataset is the dataset to use for the run. Additional arguments define how the path will be optimized (see below)&lt;br/&gt;

3. Execute one or more playouts for your run: playouts(myRun,100,[-2],50)&lt;br/&gt;
myRun: is the run to execute playouts on&lt;br/&gt;
100: is the number of events to use per playout&lt;br/&gt;
[-2]: describes the type of playouts to execute (see below)&lt;br/&gt;
50: is the number of playouts to execute&lt;br/&gt;

    playout types:

    - [-1] is compressed tree.  I.e. nodes are included/excluded
    based on their performance independent of what other
    variables were inc/exc.

    - [-2] is full tree, but see parameter settings for details on this.

    - [i,j,k] Any other list for this argument is interpreted as fixed-path running.
    All playouts will use only variable numbers i,j,k (counting from zero)

    - Numerous optional arguments define how the paths will be optimized (see below)

4. Execute more playouts on the run as needed.
Once a run object is created and playouts have been run (steps above), you can continue to run playouts on it,
and it will continue to accrue statistics from these playouts and add the results to the run&#39;s stored information.
So, you could keep calling playouts(myRun,100,[-1],50) if after looking at the reports (see below), you decide that
you want to continue with more playouts starting from the current state of the run.

5. Print text-based report textReports(myRun,n,i)
myRun specifies the run you want to report on, n indicates how many playouts should be included (0=all) in the
all-playouts section of the report, and  i indicates whether or not gate information should be included (see below)

6. Make plot-based reports plotReports(myRun,0,makePDF=False)
Makes a bunch of plots to the screen if you&#39;re in something like jupyter or have XQuartz running.  If you set
makePDF=True, then it will also send the plots to a file.

Additional parameters you can include when creating a run:

- getEvalParm: Both sides of a node must be visited this many times before either gate can be closed.  This is a
subtle and important parameter for full-tree mode.  In full-tree mode, closing a gate on one of the variables means
that if any node anywhere in the tree has gateEvalParm visits to both its include and exclude sides,
then the variable will be evaluated for possible closing one of the gates.  However, when that gate is closed,
that variable is now always included or excluded no matter where it appears in the tree in future path searches. The
nice feature of this approach is that initially, only variables near the top of the tree  (i.e., small var numbers),
which receive more visits can be shut off, since they are the nodes that will reach this threshold first.  However,
as low-numbered variables have one of their gates closed, gates further down the tree will get more visits.  So the
gate actions will propagate down the tree as playouts increase.  If one wants a proper full-tree mode with no gates
ever being closed, just set this parameter to be very large. There is currently no way to turn off gates in
individual nodes in a full tree.

- nodeEvalParm: Only used in compress-tree mode Both sides of a node must be visited this many times before policy
can be implemented to choose a side. Below this value, we flip a coin to choose a side.

- nParallel: Number of playouts that will be batched in parallel processing.  Speeds the code significantly,
but do not set this to be greater than 8 without reading the longer comment in the code itself, even if you are on a
machine with more than eight cores.
